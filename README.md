# **Analog Clock with Light/Dark Mode Toggle using JavaScript**

This project demonstrates how to build a fully functional analog clock using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The clock dynamically shows the current time, with smoothly moving hour, minute, and second hands. Additionally, it includes a light/dark mode toggle, allowing users to switch between themes to suit their viewing preference.


## **Overview**

The analog clock is designed to resemble a traditional clock, where time is updated in real-time every second. The project features a user-friendly interface, offering a seamless experience with a visually pleasing clock face and a toggle option to switch between light and dark modes.
